# Mi-Fit Data Downloader

This program is still in **BETA**, which means that it **does not** include all the functionalities yet.


## Introduction

**Mi-Fit Data Downloader**, is a program designed to automate the download of data from the Mi-Fit account. It works using **web-scraping**, since there is no API available.

## Getting Started

To start using the program, it is necessary to meet the following requirements:
- You need to have Python installed (Tested with **version 3.9**)
- You need to have Selenium installed
- You need to have a web browser installed

Explain that in this repository, the code is configured to work with **Google Chrome**. Although it can be **changed**.

In addition, it will be necessary to download the necessary **drivers** for our web browser. To do this, we can follow the instructions in the Selenium **[installation manual](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)**.

This should be placed in the following directory:

> C:/Users/*you-user*/*your-driver*.exe
